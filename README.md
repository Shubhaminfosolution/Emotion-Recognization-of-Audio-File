Project Overview
Emotion recognition is a significant application of machine learning in human-computer interaction. This project focuses on developing a model capable of recognizing emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise from audio recordings. By analyzing features extracted from the audio signals, the model can predict the underlying emotion with a high degree of accuracy.


Features
Audio Processing: Feature extraction from raw audio files using techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Emotion Classification: Trained a machine learning model to classify emotions into distinct categories.
Real-Time Prediction: Implemented a pipeline for real-time emotion recognition from live audio input.
Interactive Visualization: Visualization tools to explore and understand model predictions.

Usage
To use the model, provide an audio file or use your microphone for real-time emotion prediction. The model will process the input and output the predicted emotion.


Dataset
This project utilizes a well-known dataset for emotion recognition. The dataset contains labeled audio recordings representing different emotions. Features such as MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast are extracted for model training.


Dataset Link: [Dataset is Present in the repository]
Model Architecture
The model is built using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal features of the audio signals.


Input Layer: Audio features (MFCCs)
CNN Layers: Convolutional layers to extract spatial features
RNN Layers: LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies
Output Layer: Softmax activation for multi-class emotion classification
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing emotions from audio signals. Below are some example predictions:


Happy: 0.85
Sad: 0.90
Angry: 0.80
Surprised: 0.87


Future Work
Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
Deployment: Deploy the model as a web application for broader accessibility.
